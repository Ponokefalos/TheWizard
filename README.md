# Vue - Wizard

Vue-wizard is a Vue component that creates a step  by step wizard fast and easy. 
The main component is composed by a list of step tabs, a step progress bar, 
that shows the progress of completed steps, some navigation buttons, to move easily left and right between steps and finally 
the content component that based on each step shows the main content of currently selected step.
The wizard module loads components dynamically. Every time that a step tab is clicked there is a component resolver functionality, 
that loads the corresponding dynamic component from a list of components. In that way you can easily create new components and just
add them to the list without any other configuration!

# Use 

Clone repo and build upon the project. Just add your own tab components and add the refference to Wizard.vue component.


# ToDo
Create npm library
